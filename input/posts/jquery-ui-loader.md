God Bless the jQuery UI Framework. Designing widgets has always been a curious business where I always end up feeling unsatisfied. So, thanks to the Framework, I can focus more on development, and leave the theming up to the implementation folks [whoever they may be].

However, it's still an incomplete Framework. One feature I always felt lacking was the design of a simple table. I've stubmled upon solutions in the past for complex datagrids, but it always stank of overkill.

As it turns out, I wasn't the only one who felt this feature [lacking](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613632/jquery-ui-themes-and-html-tables/2625525#2625525).

I've tinkered with the code quit a bit since that post, but the basic idea is the same. Hope you enjoy!
