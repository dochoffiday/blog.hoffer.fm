Ho, Ho, Ho! For this year’s company Christmas card, my place of work ([Williams-Forrest](http://www.williams-forrest.com/)) decided to make a fun little site that decides whether or not you’ve been Naughty or Nice.

The application reads your Facebook posts from the past year while tallying up “nice” words and “naughty” words (each with a different weight). Once it’s compiled the list, it sums up the total. If your score is above zero, you’re nice! However, for those unlucky souls below zero, you will be branded naughty! So you better watch out!

It was a fun project to work on, and the designer, [Ryan Beck](http://ryaan.pizza/), did a pretty killer job.
