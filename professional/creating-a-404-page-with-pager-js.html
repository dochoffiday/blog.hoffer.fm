<p><a href="https://github.com/finnsson/pagerjs">Pager.js</a> is a single-page application framework for <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>, and it has a lot of neat things out-of-the-box. But if you're using it, you may wonder how to create a 404 page, since there's no explicit method for this purpose.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that this is pretty easy! Pager.js has a built-in system for <a href="https://pagerjs.com/demo/#!/navigation/matching_wildcards">wildcards</a> that provides a sort of &quot;catch-all&quot; for routes. So, if you create a <a href="http://pagerjs.com/demo/#!/navigation/structure">root page</a> (as in a page that is not nested under any other pages), just set the id to &quot;?&quot; (i.e. the wildcard marker).</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div data-bind=&quot;page: {id: '?', title: '404 - Page Not Found', scrollToTop: true, sourceCache: true }&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;404 :'(&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you do this, <em>any</em> routes that don't have matching page will fall to the root wildcard page (like what happens <a href="http://pagerjs.com/demo/#!/gobbledigook">here</a>)! Which you can design however you want!</p>
