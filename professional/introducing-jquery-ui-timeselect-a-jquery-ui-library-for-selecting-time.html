<p>There is no shortage of timepickers for JavaScript, but the majority of them are overwrought, with timepickers being one of the few categories of plugins that tends to be way more visual than they need to be.</p>
<p>jquery.ui.timeselect leverages the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/">jQuery UI</a> library and the <a href="http://www.datejs.com/">Date.js</a> library that adds an easy-to-use autocomplete feature to an existing input element, which can be used to select a time.</p>
