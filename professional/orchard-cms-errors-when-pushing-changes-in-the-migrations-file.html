<p>I really love the <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard CMS</a> (a CMS engine built upon the .NET MVC Framework), but it isn't without its quirks. I've found that often times, when I try to delete a column from an existing table in the migrations file, the site inexplicably starts throwing errors. After digging through the error log, I found that the error usually is along the following lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p property="" className="">Error when updating module: &quot;A tenant could not be started: Default NHibernate.PropertyNotFoundException: Could not find a getter for property '' in class ''&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, even though the column was deleted in the migrations file, Orchard is still looking for that column.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>This is actually a pretty easy fix. In your App_Data folder, there is a &quot;Sites&quot; folder, and within that there should be a folder matching the name of your site (usually &quot;Default&quot;). From here, simply <em>delete the &quot;mappings.bin&quot;</em> file.</p>
<p>This will clear out the mappings and create new ones from scratch. From there, you should be good to go.</p>
