<p>When the jQuery UI Button widget was introduced, I was amused,  but I wasn't exactly blown-away.  It's not as exciting as Autocomplete, Accordion, or some of the other widgets, but handy nonetheless.  However, when I discovered that it supported checkboxes and radiobuttons, I started to get excited, but only because I had yet to learn that the idea was better in theory than in practice.</p>
<p>The state difference between 'on' and 'off' are almost impossible to differentiate on some of the themes, leaving the user unable to discern whether or not his/her checkbox is 'on' or 'off'.  The problem isn't as drastic for a radiobutton, since the user can compare with the other radiobuttons in a different state, but it still wasn't practical.</p>
<p>But, there was hope.  Having a good foundation, I knew that with a few slight modifications, the Button widget's potential could be fully realized.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>I actually thought of the solution by accident.  The widget has a 'primary' and 'secondary' icon options.  I mistakenly assumed these were for the 'on' and 'off' icon states.  &quot;Why isn't there an option for an 'on' and 'off' state for icons?&quot;  It was a head scratcher.</p>
<p>To me, having an 'on' and 'off' icon seems like a pretty simple feature, which is why I was surprised when it was overlooked.  It also seemed like it would be simple to implement, and it was!</p>
<p>I took the Button widget, modified it, and voila: 'on' and 'off' state icons. [For simplicity, I removed the secondary state icon]</p>
<h3 id="the-options">The Options</h3>
<pre><code>options: {
    disabled: null,
    text: true,
    label: null,
    icons: {
    on: 'ui-icon-circle-check',
    off: 'ui-icon-minusthick'
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The only real difference is the 'icons' options, which have been renamed to 'on' and 'off' instead of 'primary' and 'secondary'.</p>
<p>The real beauty is that because it's basically a mod of the Button widget, there isn't a need for new stylesheets - the ones already included for the Button will work just fine.</p>
