<p>For the first time ever, I'm making a list of career goals for the year. I'm shooting for some low-hanging fruit here, but hey, I have to start somewhere! [If you judge me on any of these, maybe YOUR resolution should be to BACK OFF... Ok, phew, sorry. That was uncalled-for... I'll calm down.]</p>

<li>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=as2">Code Complete</a>. This book has been on my nightstand for <em>years</em>. It's my book version of Dumb &amp; Dumber. Before I actually sat down and watched Dumb &amp; Dumber straight through, I watched about 90% of it in bits and pieces [some of them many times over] through re-runs on TV. With Code Complete, I've read most of it by just picking pieces here and there to read. But this year, I'm going to finish what I started! Probably. Err... Hopefully!</li>
<li>Get business cards. Ok. So this one is probably more of a personal goal, because I don't actually think I need them and basically just want something to show off, but I have enough personal resolutions as it is, so this goal put in for a transfer.</li>
<li>Increase my StackOverflow reputation by 1,000. Right now I'm at a mildly-respectable (I think?) score of 3,165 [I'm no <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">Jon Skeet</a>]. By this time next year I hope to be <em>at least</em> at 4,165.</li>
<li>Make <em>one</em> contribution to <em>one</em> open source project. When it comes to open source, I've made a habit out of feeding off the goodwill of others without giving anything back. So this year I just want to contribute <em>something</em>. My primary road bump has always been thinking, &quot;what could little ol' me have to contribute?&quot; So I guess part of this goal is to gain a little confidence, <a href="http://m5.paperblog.com/i/30/301926/fabulous-filmic-fashion-friday-the-wizard-of--L-zQOisU.jpeg">scarecrow style</a>. [<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/finnsson/pagerjs/pull/210">done!</a>]</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it for now! Check back in about 365 days to see how I did!</p>
