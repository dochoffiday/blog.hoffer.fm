<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> to create a fairly straightforward site for a restaurant. Squarespace uses their flavour of markdown syntax when creating menu items, and for the most part it's pretty fool-proof. I did hit a small hiccup, however, when I needed to add a dollar sign ($) to a description for a menu item.</p>
<p>The problem is that when Squarespace sees the dollar sign, it assumes that text is for the price, and moves it to the bottom (which messes up everything else).</p>
<p>Here's the incorrect markdown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loch Duart Scottish Salmon Salad
Grilled sustainable salmon served a top of mixed spring greens, tomatoes and cucumber, with your choice of dressing (substitute with sesame crusted seared tuna steak for an additional $3)
$14</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-fix">The Fix</h3>
<p>To fix it, all you have to do is use the ASCII equivalent ($3) and it will work just fine!</p>
