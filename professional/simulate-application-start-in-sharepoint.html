<p>If you've worked within a SharePoint project, you may have noticed the absense of the &quot;Global.asax&quot; file. The SharePoint infrastructure doesn't include this file, so all methods within it, including the &quot;Application_Start&quot;, are also unavailable. However, with some tricky maneuvering, we are able to simulate it.</p>
<p>Instead of doing a line-by-line re-creation, I'll share with you a library I've created on GitHub and outline the basic premise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a static class with one public static method that returns &quot;true&quot; the first time it's called, otherwise it returns &quot;false&quot;.</li>
<li>Every time you visit the main master page, call the method in the static class.</li>
<li>If it returns &quot;false&quot;, do nothing.</li>
<li>If it returns &quot;true&quot;, execute any code which you would like run when the application starts.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it from a logic point of view! To view the actual source code, or to just download the binaries, head on over to the GitHub project!</p>
